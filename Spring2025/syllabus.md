### Course Policies:

- **Attendance and Participation:** Students are expected to attend all the lectures and must inform the instructor if they are unable to do so due to emergency or other legitimate reasons. Failure to attend more than 5 lectures without permission from the instructor will result in 5% penalty in your overall grade.
- **Weekly Exercises:** Weekly exercises are due on Fridays before midnight. These are short questions that require you to write programs based on the examples shown in class. The goal of these exercises is to help you get familiarize with the tools/programming languages used in the class. No late submission will be accepted. Only the top-8 highest scores from the exercises will count towards computing your final grade. 
- **Assignment and Late Submission Policy:** Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date unless specified otherwise.
All written portion of your assignments must be typed and submitted in PDF format. You must use [D2L](http://d2l.msu.edu) to submit a soft copy of your solution. Late assignments will be penalized 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted the next day after the deadline) or 50% (if submitted the second day after the deadline). Assignments submitted later than that will not be accepted.
- **Exam Information:** There will be 2 exams in this class. All exams will be open book and notes. Make-up examination can be arranged if your absence is due to documented illness or personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to the instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. Except for emergency cases, make-up arrangements must be made in advance, before the scheduled exam. 
- **Discussion Forum:** We will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/msu/spring2025/cse801a) for class discussion. Rather than emailing class-related questions to the instructor and TA, you are strongly encouraged to post them on Piazza. However, do not post your solution or attempted solution (e.g., for programming exercises, assignments or project) on Piazza. 
- **Study Groups:** You are allowed to form study groups to learn the materials in class. However, you are forbidden from sharing the solution of your programming exercises, homework assignments, and programming project with other students. All submitted assignments must be your own work. Students who were found copying or sharing their solutions with other students will automatically receive a zero for the entire assignment. In addition, an Academic Dishonesty Report will be filed and submitted to the university.
- **Resources for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD):** Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884-RCPD or on the web at rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued an Accommodation Letter (formerly known as a VISA). Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (exam, homework, etc). Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible. 
- **Academic Honesty:** All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system provided by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and College of Engineering. The Department of Computer Science adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life; Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 on the assignment/exam/quiz.
- **Generative AI:** Generative AI may be used for finding examples on how to use certain library functions for your code; however, it may not be used to impersonate you, e.g., by providing the answer for your homework questions or the complete code for your homework assignment. You are responsible for the information you submit based on an AI query (for instance, that it does not violate intellectual property laws, or contain misinformation or unethical content). Your use of AI tools must be properly documented and cited in order to stay within university policies on academic integrity and the Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge. If you're unsure about this, please contact the instructor.   
- **Religious Observance:** MSU is home to a diverse and multicultural community of students, faculty, and staff which we value and actively support to observe days set aside by their chosen religious faith. The Religious Observance Policy states, "It is the responsibility of those students who need to be absent to inform their instructor at least two weeks before the observance day, make arrangements in advance with their instructors, and to catch up on any material discussed and assignments given during that class period." Please remember to contact your instructor early in the semester if such arrangements are needed.  
- **Tolerance and Civility** MSU strives to build an academic community with living and learning environments that expects tolerance of viewpoints and civility toward others, whether at public forums, athletic events, in residential communities, classrooms or laboratories. We call upon all who participate in university events to promote tolerance and civil behavior and to hold themselves to high standards that reflect the university’s commitment to respect viewpoints that may be different from their own. Only by respecting individuals with diverse perspectives and ideas can we build an environment of civility that is conducive to advancing knowledge and transforming lives.
